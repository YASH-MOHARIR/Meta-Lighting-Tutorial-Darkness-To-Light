# World Design Terms

**Core Mechanics** The core mechanics are the fundamental gameplay elements and interactions that define how players engage with the virtual world. These mechanics are essential for achieving objectives, earning rewards, and progressing within the world.

**Feedback** Feedback refers to the sensory responses provided to the player through auditory (sound), visual (sight), and haptic (touch) cues. Proper feedback can enhance the immersive experience by making interactions more realistic.

**Feature Locking** Feature locking is a design tool that helps prevent scope creep by restricting the addition of new features. Before implementing feature locking, it is essential to ensure that the minimum viable product (MVP) features are thoroughly designed and documented, ensuring the project remains focused and that core functionalities are delivered without unnecessary expansions.

**Gameplay Loop** The core gameplay loop is the sequence of repetitive actions that players take to achieve objectives, earn rewards, and progress within the world. This loop keeps players engaged and motivated to continue exploring and interacting with the world.

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of the world that includes all required features, fully designed, developed, polished, and tested. An MVP is release-ready and can be launched without further features. Additional updates can be made post-release to enhance the world.

**Platform** Platform is the medium through which players can access the world, such as VR, web, and mobile. Supporting multiple platforms ensures a wider reach and accessibility.

**Player Goals** Player goals are the objectives and tasks that players aim to complete within the world. There are three types of goals: moment-to-moment goals, sub-goals, and primary goals.

* **Moment-to-Moment Goals** Moment-to-moment goals are the immediate, short-term objectives that players pursue while in the world. These goals provide continuous small challenges and rewards as they explore the world.  
* **Primary Goals** Primary goals are the main objectives that players strive to complete within the world. These goals often represent significant milestones or achievements.  
* **Sub Goals** Sub-goals are the intermediate objectives that players need to achieve while working towards the primary goal(s). These goals help structure the gameplay experience by breaking down larger tasks into manageable steps.  
  **Scope** The scope of a project refers to the overall size, complexity, and amount of work required to complete a world. This includes all of the world's features, content, resources, and the amount of time and money needed to complete it.  
  **Scope Creep** Scope creep is the gradual expansion of the goals and features of a world beyond its original objectives. This can occur when new ideas and features are continuously added uncontrollably.  
  **Target Audience** The target audience is the specific group of people for whom the world is designed, based on shared demographics, interests, and behaviors. This helps ensure the world appeals to and engages the intended players effectively.  
  **World Genre** A world genre is a category of worlds that share similar themes, styles, and gameplay elements, such as fantasy, sci-fi, or social hangouts. These genres guide design choices to create a fun and engaging environment for the player.  
  **World Hook** A hook is a unique and engaging feature that captures players' attention and encourages them to explore and interact with the world. It could be a distinctive visual style, innovative gameplay mechanic, or compelling narrative.  
  **World Rating** A world rating is a classification indicating whether the content of a world is appropriate for a specific age group.  
  **QA** The process of testing and evaluating a game to ensure it meets technical, design, and player experience standards before release. It’s not just about finding bugs—it’s about safeguarding the *fun* and functionality of the game.  
* **Alpha Testing:** An internal test by the development team and close friends and focuses on ensuring that the game’s core systems, mechanics, and features function correctly.   
* **Beta Testing:** An external test for real-world feedback, examining gameplay balance, usability, and performance across diverse hardware and network conditions.
